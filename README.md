# dclib
Decoupled library, a group of useful components implementing the DecoupledIO interface from Chisel3

This library is a collection of components I have found useful in building Chisel-based designs.  Many
of the components in this library were ported over from similar components implemented in Verilog in
the sdlib repository.
